Custom Formatter
================

Formatting experiment with custom objects. Implementing IFormattable etc.

My Conclusion
=============

This is some nice stuff. Turns out, you can write ToString(String) and then String.Format will call this,
when the format placeholder is {N:<this is passed to ToString>}.

10/10 - Would Recommend.
