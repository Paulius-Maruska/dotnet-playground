Console Colors
==============

An experiment with Console colors. I know very well, that `System.Console`
has `ForegroundColor` and `BackgroundColor` properties. That does not help
when trying to pretty log formatter for the console where the output must
be a string. So this is actually an experiment with [ANSI escape codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).

My Conclusion
=============

As expected - default windows console window is dumb as a shoe. PowerShell
isn't any smarter either. Good thing I'm not using them, eh?

Stuff I use:

  - [conemu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/)
  - [clink](http://mridgers.github.io/clink/)
